_______________________________________________________________________________

My name is Joseph, though I go by various aliases online. This site is a place
for me to collect my thoughts in one spot and stay independent of other
platforms.

It takes a man with a fair bit of ego to speak online as if anyone genuinely
cares what he has to say, but that is not the aim here. This website exists
purely for my own enjoyment, without worrying about SEO or whether anyone else
appreciates it.

This website and its contents are licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0, The design
of this website is inspired by the KISS Linux website. Flockless is also a
proud member of the 250KB Club.

_______________________________________________________________________________

I am from Ireland, I am young, and I earn well for a college student. The
minimum wage here is already comfortably above the EU average, so I genuinely
do not need donations.

That said, if you like the technology that is Monero, appreciate Flockless, or
simply have spare funds with nothing better to do, feel free to send a tip.
This money will only go towards paying for expenses related to this website.

IF YOU HAVE SPARE CHANGE WITH NOTHING BETTER TO SPEND MONEY ON, I WOULD RATHER
RECOMMEND THAT YOU GIVE IT TO TRÓCAIRE OR ANOTHER CHARITY OF YOUR CHOICE.
