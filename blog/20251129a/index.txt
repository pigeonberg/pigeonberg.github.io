Millenium MPS-450 Review                                            2025-11-29
________________________________________________________________________________

I bought the Millenium MPS-450 as my first drum kit and, overall, I think it
offers great value for beginners who want a solid and affordable way to start
learning at home. After spending time with it, here is my honest experience.

[001] Sound and Playability ----------------------------------------------------

 For the price, the MPS-450 sounds better than I expected. Some kits sound
 more pleasant than others, so you need to scroll through them to find what
 feels good, but once you do, it is perfectly enjoyable for practice. The
 mesh-head snare is responsive, it feels a lot closer to an acoustic drum than
 the rubber pads I have seen on cheaper kits.

 The cymbals work fine, although they are not multi-zone, so you do not not
 get features like edge or bell triggering. It is not a dealbreaker for
 beginners, just something to keep in mind as you progress and improve.


[002] Size and Playing Comfort -------------------------------------------------

 One thing I did not think about when buying a compact e-drum kit is whether I
 would actually fit comfortably. I am 193cm, and I found myself squeezing into
 the setup more than I expected. The kit is small, and although you can adjust
 the rack, there is only so much room to make it taller or wider.

 I was focusing too much on saving space in my room and forgot about the
 importance of physical comfort, so if you are around my height or taller, I
 strongly recommend trying out a similar-sized kit in a shop before buying,
 just to get a sense of scale.

 On the other hand, I had one of the shorter people I know test it, she is
 147cm and she had no issues at all, so height makes a big difference with
 this kit.


[003] Noise Levels -------------------------------------------------------------

 It is quieter than an acoustic drum set, obviously, but it is not silent. The
 biggest noise comes from the kick pedal on the floor. If you live in a flat
 or you are upstairs, the vibration will travel, and depending on your
 neighbours, they might hear it. Personally, I ended up moving it downstairs
 which solved the problem, but it is something to think about before you buy.


[004] Build Quality ------------------------------------------------------------

 The rack is sturdy enough for practice and does not wobble once everything is
 tightened. It is not built like a high-end kit of course, but for its price
 range it feels reliable. All the pads respond consistently and so far I have
 not had issues with durability.


[005] Final Thoughts -----------------------------------------------------------

 The Millenium MPS-450 is a strong starter kit, especially if you are learning
 at home and want something affordable, simple and reliable. It does have
 limitations, mainly in cymbal zones, physical size and noise transfer through
 the floor, but none of these stop it from being a solid choice for beginners.

 I would recommend it for anyone who wants an easy way to start drumming
 without spending a lot.
